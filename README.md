Codefundo Natural disaster management

The goal in mind is to minimise the effect of natural disasters on human lives and economy. To do this, there logically appear to be two ways. Firstly we could stop the natural disaster itself, for example walls around a costal area to negate high tides during a tsunami. Expecting this to work efficiently however, is unreasonable. The other option is to prepare for it beforehand such as to keep its impact to a minimum. To do this we need to be aware in advance with a certain degree of certainty that a given natural disaster will be occuring within a certain timeframe. 

We believe that some weather features like humidity, average precipitation, etc. are follow certain patterns in the time leading up to a certain calamities like storms, typhoons and tornadoes. Hence, having a machine learning model to learn these patterns could help raise flags in the future if such patterns begin to appear again.
